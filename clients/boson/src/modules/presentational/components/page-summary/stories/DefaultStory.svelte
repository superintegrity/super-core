    As one of the most popular means of saving for retirement, self-managed
    super funds (SMSF) is often considered as the do-it-yourself option and as
    such an easily managed structure. In fact, SMSFs are complicated. They
    operate in a highly regulated environment with countless rules, compliance
    obligations and legislation updates, in which trustees and their
    professional advisers can easily get lost.
