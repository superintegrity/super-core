  “I was recommended by a friend to use Super Integrity for my SMSF tax and have
  been very pleased with all the advice and support I’ve received. There is
  always a prompt response to any of my queries. They also keep me up to date
  with new super rules, which is very helpful. The way they explain the super
  and tax laws to me is very easy to understand, no jargons! I would definitely
  recommend them to anyone who is looking for an SMSF accountant.”
